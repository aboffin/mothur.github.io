The goal of mothur is to have a single resource to analyze molecular
data that is used by microbial ecologists. Many of these tools are
available elsewhere as individual programs and as scripts, which tend to
be slow or as web utilities, which limit your ability to analyze your
data. mothur offers the ability to go from raw sequences to the
generation of visualization tools to describe α and β diversity.
Examples of each command are provided within their specific pages, but
several users have provided several [analysis
examples](/wiki/analysis_examples), which use these commands. An
exhaustive list of the commands found in mothur is available within the
[ commands category index](/wiki/tags#commands). If you have
any questions, complaints, or praise, please do not hesitate to [email Pat](mailto:pschloss@umich.edu) or to use the [user forum](https://forum.mothur.org):
